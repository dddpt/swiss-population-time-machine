ES6
================

todo:
- separate index.js file in relevant chunks
- adopt object oriented approach for each component (map, graph)
- make them properly data-independant and instanciable, (so as to make it possible to have multiple maps/graphs on 1 page)
- use the es6 module approach

OO approach:
- class



React + redux
================

On wait until es6 transition done
